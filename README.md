# 📇 Contact Manager App – Day 21 of #100DaysOfReact

Welcome to Day 21 of my #100DaysOfReact journey!  
Today I completed the **Frontend** of a fully functional Contact Manager App. Built with **React**, it allows users to:

### ✅ Features

- 🔍 Search and filter contacts by name or email
- 🔃 Sort contacts alphabetically
- 🗑️ Delete contacts
- 📷 Contact image section with styled layout
- ✅ Form validation using Regular Expressions

### 📁 Tech Stack
- **React**
- **CSS Modules**
